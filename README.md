# NodeJS Cloud Native Buildpack

The NodeJS Cloud Native Buildpack provides a set of collaborating buildpacks that
enable the building of a NodeJS-based application. These buildpacks include:
- [Node Engine CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/node-engine)
- [Yarn Install CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/yarn-install)
- [NPM CNB](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks/npm)

The buildpack supports building simple Node applications or applications which
utilize either [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
for managing their dependencies. Support for each of these package managers is
mutually exclusive.

THIS IS JUST A BRANCH THAT WE'RE USING TO COMPARE FOR WHATEVER'S SAKE
